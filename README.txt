To run the code for project 2, Randomized Optimization:

1. download the repository from https://github.com/pdayboch/ml-proj2-rl.git
2. cd ml-proj2-rl to navigate into the project's root directory
3. python3 randomoptimizers.py

The machine running this code will need numpy, scikit-learn, and pyplot installed as Python libraries.

This code also uses the Mlrose library, but changes had to be made to the library and the source code is included in this repository, so it is unnecessary for the packge to be installed.
